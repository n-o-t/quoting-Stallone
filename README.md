## Quote from Sylvester Stallone

A simple react app displaying quotes from Sylvester Stallone as himself and as his movie characters.

## Motivation

This project is for the upcoming new year's eve, where and when I should disguise as a 80's character, so I deciced to embed this on a portable screen, probably a Raspberry Pi touch screen, so the party guest can read (and enjoy) random quotes from this guy who is supposedly an archetype (and probably the acme for some of us) of what 80's finest cultural production is.

## Installation
